Go follows package, import and func order

Variable :
    String, int, float, boolean.. etc

    String can be added using + 
    we already know 2+3, 2.3 + 4.5 works 

    f := "apple" is only available within a func not outside..

    A const statement can appear anywhere a var statement can.
    const s string = "APPLE"

Looping:
    Go has only for looping
    for loop can be used as while, infinte loop

    for i:= range 6 // loop from 1 to 6

Conditional:
    if, else if, else

Switch:
    basic remain same as in other langauge, just no need of break after eash case

    Check interface type 
        whatAmI := func(i interface{}) {
        switch t := i.(type) {
        case bool:
            fmt.Println("I'm a bool")
        case int:
            fmt.Println("I'm an int")
        default:
            fmt.Printf("Don't know type %T\n", t)
        }
    }

    whatAmI(true)
    whatAmI(1)
    whatAmI("ANJANI")

Slice:
    s := []int{1,2,3}
    s = make([]string, 3) // slice with zerod value
    c := make([]string, len(s))
    copy(c, s) // copy slice s to c
